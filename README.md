# üöÄ Enhancing Health and Business Insights with Diabetes Prediction

## üìä Overview

This project applies data mining and machine learning to understand key diabetes risk factors using the CDC's BRFSS2015 dataset. Our aim is twofold:  
- **Advance public health insights** by identifying high-impact predictors of diabetes.  
- **Guide health insurers** in designing specialized, data-driven plans for high-risk individuals, supporting prevention and improved management while optimizing business growth.

## üõ†Ô∏è Analytical Approach

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing

- **Class Imbalance**: Created three training sets: original, oversampled, and undersampled to address the imbalance in diabetes status.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c66f6d84-19de-4326-a545-5c2c86518a8f)
  ```r
  # Oversampling the minority class in the training set
  train.df1.oversampled1 <- ovun.sample(Diabetes_binary ~ ., data = train.df1, method = "over", N = 340000)$data

  # Undersampling the majority class in the training set
  train.df1.undersampled1 <- ovun.sample(Diabetes_binary ~ ., data = train.df1, method = "under", N = 58000)$data
  ```
  
  ```r
  # Visualize the class imbalance before and after sampling
  barplot(table(train.df1$Diabetes_binary), main = "Original Class Distribution")
  barplot(table(train.df1.oversampled1$Diabetes_binary), main = "Oversampled Class Distribution")
  barplot(table(train.df1.undersampled1$Diabetes_binary), main = "Undersampled Class Distribution")
  ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Predictive Modeling

#### Classification Tree

```r
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
tree_cv2 <- rpart(Diabetes_binary ~ ., data = train.df1, 
                  method = "class", minbucket = 30, cp = 0.0022)
rpart.plot(tree_cv2, digits = -2)
```

#### Random Forest Variable

```r
library(randomForest)
set.seed(123, sample.kind = "Rejection")
rf_final1 <- randomForest(Diabetes_binary ~ ., data = train.df1, 
                          ntree = 20, nodesize = 50, mtry = 3)
varImpPlot(rf_final1)
```

#### Logistic Regression

```r
# Logistic Regression Model by using training dataset
logreg1 <- glm(Diabetes_binary ~ HighBP + BMI + HighChol + DiffWalk + PhysHlth +
               HeartDiseaseorAttack + PhysActivity + Stroke,
               data = train.df1, family = "binomial")
summary(logreg1)
exp(coef(logreg1)) # Odds ratios

# Logistic Regression Model by using oversampled training dataset
logreg1a <- glm(Diabetes_binary ~ HighBP + BMI + HighChol + DiffWalk + PhysHlth +
                HeartDiseaseorAttack + PhysActivity + Stroke,
                data = train.df1.oversampled1, family = "binomial")
summary(logreg1a)
exp(coef(logreg1a)) # Odds ratios

# Logistic Regression Model by using undersampled training dataset
logreg1b <- glm(Diabetes_binary ~ HighBP + BMI + HighChol + DiffWalk + PhysHlth +
                HeartDiseaseorAttack + PhysActivity + Stroke,
                data = train.df1.undersampled1, family = "binomial")
summary(logreg1b)
exp(coef(logreg1b)) # Odds ratios

### üîó Hierarchical Clustering

![Hierarchical Clustering](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/198a14d6-a6b1-4e73-8add-fd5eb7af7d17)

Top 3 factors that show the highest changes are stroke, high blood pressure, and heart disease.

## üèÜ Key Results

- **Top predictors**: HighBP, BMI, HighChol, DiffWalk, PhysHlth, HeartDiseaseorAttack, Stroke, PhysActivity.
- **Odds Ratios**: HighBP increases odds by 2.85xÔºõ physical activity reduces odds by ~0.82x.
- **Model Insights**:
  - Original data: High specificity, low sensitivity (misses positives).
  - Oversampled/Undersampled: Balanced sensitivity/specificity, lower overall accuracy.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Individuals with elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, heart disease, or stroke history should monitor these closely.
  - Insurers should target high-risk groups to improve care and business outcomes.
